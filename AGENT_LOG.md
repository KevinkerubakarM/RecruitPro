# AI Usage Area

- First I have designed application structure and created instruction files for frontend and backend to guide AI (.github/instructions folder)
- Used Claude Sonnet 4.5 as agent

# Prompting

- Design Login Form and Sign up Form, design related types,validators,schema,routes
- Followed same for creating other pages
- Update instructions to keep note of common functionality

# Optimizing

- Used AI to create SEO friendly pages
- Remove unused logics and separate components

# Debugging

- Whenever faced issues, shared the error details and its realted code and AI agent fixed some issues
- There are some areas where AI cant able to debug and fix issues, so I prompted to share line of issues and summary of possible issues, in that case I have fixed manually

# Idea generation

- Used Agents to suggest me technology that I can utilize for data storage
